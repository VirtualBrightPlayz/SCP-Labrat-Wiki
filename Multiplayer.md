# Multiplayer

In SCP: Labrat, there are two different ways to play multiplayer with others

- Relay Lobbies
- Dedicated Servers

## Relay Lobbies

A lobby is hosted by one person, and others can join by using a unique identifier, also called a lobby code. Anyone can easily host a relay lobby using the in-game host buttons.

### Pros

- No need to share IP addresses, port forward, or use hacky NAT tricks
- Easy to setup
- Great for one-time games with friends

### Cons

- High latency
- Single point of failure (relay goes offline or host disconnects/leaves, the lobby is closed)

## Dedicated Servers

A dedicated server is hosted by community members, and is able to be online 24/7. Although anyone can host a server, there are some requirements that *must* be met.

### Pros

- No single person has to be online for the server to be online for others
- Great for building a community

### Cons

- Requires the server owner to port forward
- Not as easy to use
